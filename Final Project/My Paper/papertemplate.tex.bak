%% Intro %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction} Your paper should have an intro where you give the background information on the PDE and why it is interesting.  This should be where you give
a literature review.  Citations are done like this, \cite{1986BrandtA-aa,2001TrottenbergU_OosterleeC_SchullerA-aa}.

\section{More Sections}

This is how you do a table.  
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
{\small
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

\hline

Time&Grid&DOF&Nwt Steps&Avg V-cycles&Work Units&Avg WU/Timestep\\

\hline

1-82&6&595&1&4&0.011&\\

1-82&5&2,079&2&11.&0.118&\\

1-82&4&7,735&2&14.1&0.650&\\

1-82&3&29,799&2&17.8&3.421&$\approx 35$ WU\\

1-82&2&116,935&1&15.7&12.677&\\

1-82&1&463,239&1&5.7&18.358&\\
\hline

83-200&6&595&2&8&0.021&\\

83-200&5&2,079&2&11&0.118&\\

83-200&4&7,735&2&18.4&0.852&\\

83-200&3&29,799&2&21&4.063& $\approx 77$ WU\\

83-200&2&116,935&1&20.9&16.869&\\

83-200&1&463,239&1&16.9&55.036&\\

\hline

\end{tabular}
}

\caption{Number of degrees of freedom (DOF), Newton steps, and V-cycles used at each level and timestep.  The number of work units (WU) or equivalent fine-grid relaxations are also computed here.}
\label{tearingunif}
\end{table}



Look I referenced Table \ref{tearingunif}. 

This is how we itemize.
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.]	I one the sandbox.
\item[2.] I two the sandbox. 
\item[3.]	I three the sandbox.
\item[4.] I four the sandbox. 
\item[5.]	I five the sandbox.
\item[6.] I six the sandbox. 
\item[7.]	I seven the sandbox.
\item[8.] I eight the sandbox. 
\item[9.] That's gross...
\end{itemize}
	
\section{Another Section}
\subsection{With Subsections}

This is how to include a figure.  By the way:
%comments work like this...
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{filename}
\caption{I am a caption.  I really wish I had a figure...}
\label{myfig}
\end{figure}

This is how your reference a figure, like Figure \ref{myfig}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Conclusion %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}
You should definitely have a conclusion or discussion section.  Summarize your findings and discuss what future aspects may be studied on the topic. 

Oh yes, and don't forget to spellcheck!!!!!!
