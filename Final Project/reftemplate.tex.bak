\maketitle

The proposal explained a routine using Polar Coordinates and Finite-Difference Schemes to solve the heat diffusion equation representing the cooling process of a Nuclear Waste Rod. The author provided the PDE in X-Y-t axis and explained how to transfer it into R-$\phi$-t axis, where the angle component is of no importance. Then the author provided a reasonable initial condition and pointed out the FDMs he/she wants to use and study.
\\

Give a couple of sentences giving your overall review of the proposal.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a list of comments and/or suggestions.

\item If you are referring to a very specific portion of text, please
  indicate the page and where in the text it appears.

\item You do not have to use this itemized list format.  It is merely
  a suggestion.

\end{enumerate}

Final remarks?
